1. What exactly is []?

ANS: [] is a emplty list

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value &#39;hello&#39; as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
ANS: spam.insert(3,'hello')

3. What is the value of spam[int(int(&#39;3&#39; * 2) / 11)]?
ANS: 'd'

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
ANS: 'd'
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
ANS: ['a', 'b']

Let&#39;s pretend bacon has the list [3.14, &#39;cat,&#39; 11, &#39;cat,&#39; True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index(&#39;cat&#39;)?
ANS: 1
7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
ANS: [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
8. How does bacon.remove(&#39;cat&#39;) change the look of the list in bacon?
ANS: [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
ANS: Concatination(+) = l + l1
     replication(*) = l * 3
10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
ANS: append method add the element at the end of the list
     insert method add the element in the list on the basis of the index given by the user.
11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
ANS: remove and pop are the methods for removing items from a list.
12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
ANS: list Values are stored in the form of int, string, complex, tuple, list etc.
     String values are stored in the form of char enclosed with '' or "" or str()
13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?
ANS: Tuples : - Tuples are imutable collection
     List : List is a mutable collection 
14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
ANS: int
15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value&#39;s list form?
ANS: by typecasting
     tuple(l), where l is a list
     list(t), where t is a tuple
16. Variables that &quot;contain&quot; list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
ANS: element of the list
17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
ANS: copy.copy() will copy the collection in different location and can be checked by using id() upto an extent.
    copy.deepcopy() will copy the collection recursively and only this will only applicable in case of nested list where using deep copy will store a new location.
