l = ['a.text','b.text','c.text','d.text','e.text','f.text','g.text''h.text','i.text','j.text']
l1 = []
for i in l:
    f = open(i,'w')
    f = open(i,'r+')
    f.write("Himanshu sharma")
    f.seek(0)
    r = f.read()
    l1.append(r)
l1
for i in l1:
    f = open('new.txt','w')
    f.seek(len(i))
    f.writelines(i)

for j in 'new.txt':    
    f = open('new.txt','r+')
    # f.seek(0)
    e = f.read()
